Unity is a software solutionthat enables legal firms to efficiently execute different types of matter, according to their own business processes.

Key concepts include:

- Guided workflow- business processes captured in the software to direct users towards the correct activities based on the current state of the matter, provide context, instruction and validation on how to execute the next step in the workflow

- Document driven- precedents drive the required data collection and workflow tasks required to collect that data

- Flexible and reusable for multiple areas of law- the core functionalities (workflow, precedents, document storage, customer communication etc.) can be reused by many different areas of law. Core areas of law can be pre-configured by us and sold separately as modules. Customers can also have the ability to customise existing areas of law to account for their own organisation’s specific workflow or document requirements.

Our goal is to build a product that be be extended into multiple areas of law and meet the bespoke requirements of customers by building a core platform with a toolkit for customisation. Therefore the product can be seen from these perspectives:

1. **Matter Workflow Execution (End Users)**

   The end users execute or interact with matters according to the business processes

- e.g. lawyer creates a new matter
- e.g. a lawyer’s customer enters some details into the customer portal

2. **Matter Workflow Design (Toolkit Users)**

   The Toolkit users create the workflow that captures the business processes. Different types of matters executed by different companies have unique business processes. Our goal is provide flexibility so that different workflows can be created using a

- e.g. D&D Professional Services team builds default workflows for different areas of law, that would be selected by a Small Business Owner
- e.g. D&D Professional Services team builds a customised workflow in consultation with a Partner at a large law firm
- e.g. a Practice Manager uses the Unity toolkit to develop a customised workflow
