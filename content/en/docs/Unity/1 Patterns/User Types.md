There are many personas and use cases covered by Unity but they generally fit into one of these categories.

## Legal Firm Users

The users who work for a legal firm that uses Unity for matter management. These users execute or interact with matters according to their organisation's processes. 

Examples include:

* lawyer creates a new matter
* legal assistant enters data received from a customer into a matter
* practice manager views reporting statistics

## Our Customer's Customer

Legal firm users delegate Unity access to their customers, who have a limited set of actions they can perform according to the legal firm's processes.

Examples include:

* a legal firm's client views the status of their matter
* a conveyancer's customer enters some details into the customer portal
* a real estate agent uses Unity to generate a property contract

## Toolkit Users

Unity provides a toolkit for customisation. The Toolkit provides features for customising precedents and workflows. Toolkit users create precedents and workflows to capture business processes.

Examples include:

- D&D Professional Services team builds default workflows for different areas of law, that would be selected by a Small Business Owner
- D&D Professional Services team provides consulting services to a large law firm for building out a custom workflow
- a Practice Manager uses the Unity toolkit to develop a customised workflow
