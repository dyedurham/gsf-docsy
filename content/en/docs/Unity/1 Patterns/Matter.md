Unity is centred around the concept of a Matter, which includes all of the data and activities required by a user to complete a unit of work. Each matter could have:

- data
- workflow
- precedents & documents

While the Matter entity was originally intended to map directly to a legal Matter, it could be any ‘Unit of Work’, including a legal matter, a sub-phase within a legal matter, or a unit of work that is not a legal matter at all.

Future examples could include:

- a workflow for a real estate agent property sale
- a builder managing the construction of a new building
- a company managing the pipeline for hiring and onboarding new staff members.
