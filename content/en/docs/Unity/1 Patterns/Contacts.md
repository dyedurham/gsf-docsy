A Contact is a person, company or organisation that can be related to a matter for some purpose. Contacts can be linked to a matter via a Matter Relationship, and can be reused across multiple matters.

The GSF.Contacts service acts as an 'address book', storing details about each Contact such as name, address, company registration details.

For an Organisation contact, Individuals can be linked in different positions. For example, a Company could have a Director, a Partner and a Secretary. The individuals would also be Contacts within the Contacts store.
